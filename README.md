# RavenfieldSim
Ravenfield is a simplistic low poly war simulator game. I wanted to take the simulation further by pretending that the war ranges on a large map so I built a game that allows you to make a map, mark cities, and build fighting units to make ravenfield more immersive. Mostly a personal project done for fun.
